# Introduction
---
A simple web app that simulates a library where user can add and remove Books. I used this project to get more familiar with JavaScript obects and 
array methods. This [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) is a part of the Javascript / NodeJS full stack curriculum. 

Enjoy!
